# Personal Website Project
## Project Description
Welcome to the Personal Website Project! The primary objective of this project is to design and develop your very own personal website. This website will serve as a platform to showcase your skills, experiences, and interests. The emphasis is on creating a visually appealing and easily navigable site that effectively communicates information about you and your background.

- Technologies Used
The entire project is built using HTML and CSS, with a deliberate decision to exclude JavaScript. This choice not only simplifies the development process but also provides an opportunity to focus on creating a clean and static website.

- Key Features
Responsive Design: Ensure that your website looks great and functions well across various devices and screen sizes.

- Navigation: Implement a clear and intuitive navigation system to help visitors easily explore different sections of your website.

- Skill Showcase: Dedicate a section to highlight your skills and expertise. Use appropriate visuals and descriptions to make it engaging.

- Contact Information: Include a way for visitors to reach out to you. This could be an email address or a contact form, depending on your preference.
